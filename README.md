# E-Commerce Back End

## Overview

Internet retail, also known as **e-commerce**, is the largest sector of the electronics industry.  In this project, I was tasked to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. In doing so I  configured a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.
